### What is this boilerpvlate template for? 

Imagine just running a command to get started without painfully integrating the tasks on the frontend build environments profiles like development and production release.

We handle your build accordingly based on development and release. A case would be your package bundled in development will get raw uniminified , logged codes and watching to your live edited resources with auto reload each time you change.

In production , the bundled will be a minified , uglified and compressed codes that removes logger and more.

### What is so special about this Backbone Series  ?
This backbone series capitalize alot on handling the structure setup the mvc framework of backbone whereby you can quickly fully utilize the models, collections,controllers and bind the views into the handlebar sheet [.hbs] files.

The backbone code will be written in coffescript which gives you alot opportunity to write good structure code that use class functions, design patterns like singletons and good lifecylce for each componentizations.

In this series, the handlebar moustache custom helper is also configured with some custom conditions like if equal condition, and more. So you can immediately use it and add more custom helpers!
